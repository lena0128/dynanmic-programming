# Big O

### Brute Force
* m = target sum
* n = numbers
* Time Complexity: O(nm) => n to the m
* Space Complexity: O(m)
* Note that the maximum height of the tree here can be considered as m (the worst case is -1 on each node from root to the leaf)

### Memoizition
* m = target sum
* n = numbers
* Time Complexity: O(n*m)
* Space Complexity: O(m)
