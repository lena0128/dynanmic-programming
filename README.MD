# Dynamic Programming

### Memoization
The most important thing to solve dynamic programming problem using memoization is stick to high level steps. 
* 1. Make a recursive solution work. It is OK if it runs slow.
- (1).visualize the problem as a tree
- (2).implement the tree using recursion
- (3).test it
<br />

* 2. After that make it efficient.
- (1).add a memo object 
<br />
Make sure this memo object is shared with all of your recursive calls; one way you can do it is to pass them along as arguments. 

- (2).add a base case to return memo values
- (3). store return values into the memo
